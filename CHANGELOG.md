## [1.2.0] 2017-01-20
### Fixed
- PNDA-2595: xvdc volume mounted on /var/log/pnda instead of /var/log/panda

### Added
- PNDA-2043: The CLI now checks for salt error and halt execution if found
- PNDA-2533: Ability to create an ElasticSearch cluster for external usage
- PNDA-2571: Work to allow, future, Offline installation

## [1.1.0] 2016-12-12
### Changed
 - PNDA-2397: Generate the list of valid flavors dynamically. The valid values for the --branch parameter were hard coded, now they are generated based on the folder names under 'cloud-formation/'
 - PNDA-2393: Update OS volume sizes for instances. Increase the standard size from 30 GB to 50 GB and for kafka from 50 GB to 150 GB.
 
### Added
- PNDA-2142: Allow subnet IP ranges to be specified in pnda_env.yaml and used as parameters to the cloud formation templates
- PNDA-2142: Allow any parameters to be passed through to the cloud formation templates, two settings have changed their names because they are now directly passed through - AWS_IMAGE_ID > imageId and AWS_ACCESS_WHITELIST > whitelistSshAccess. Update these in pnda_env.yaml otherwise the default value in the cloud formation template will be used.

### Fixed
 - PNDA-2313: CLI fails fast if errors occur in individual commands. Capturing logs on the cloud instance with `command | tee` (PNDA-2266) caused the CLI to carry on if an error was returned by command, because the final exit code was set by tee.
 - PNDA-2284: Use correct archive parameters to configure s3 archive credentials (the set of variables for the application package bucket were being used)
 - PNDA-2420: Add missing tee to capture logs when running expand salt commands. This missing command also caused the expand operation to fail for standard flavor clusters.

### Added

- PNDA-2266: Save provisioning logs on the cloud instances in the /home/ubuntu folder
